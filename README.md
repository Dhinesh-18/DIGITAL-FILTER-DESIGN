DOMAIN: VLSI

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

OVERVIEW:

This project involves designing and simulating a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using Verilog or MATLAB. The FIR filter is implemented for digital signal processing applications, ensuring accurate filtering with stable response characteristics.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

Implement an FIR filter using Verilog or MATLAB. Perform simulation to validate the filter's response. Analyze the filter’s performance based on frequency response and stability.

DELIVERABLES:

✅ Verilog Code for FIR Filter ✅ Simulation Results Demonstrating Filter Operation ✅ Performance Analysis of the FIR Filter

INSTRUCTIONS:

Clone this repository. Implement the FIR filter using Verilog or MATLAB. Simulate the design using appropriate tools (ModelSim, MATLAB Simulink, etc.). Analyze the filter’s response and document the results.
